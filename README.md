# Cente - A OIDC Toolkit for Kubernetes users

## Why "Cente"
The first time I discovered the flow of Dex and Gangway and how all these tools were set up solely to perform a callback for the OIDC flow, I thought this stuff is indecente. 'Indecente' is the Italian word that indicates a lack of decency, so becouse i wanna see if we can do a more coomprensive toolkit or flow then that this project is called just Cente. I really hope this can be DE instead IN :-) .
